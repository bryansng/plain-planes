	- Volume Adjustment by User.

	- You can keep pressing the key "P" and the ship gets moved to the original position.

	Timer:
	- Current Timer runs even when the game is paused. Need better time alternatives. Try looking into time.perf_counter(). (Time = Game Start Time - Process_time)

		Bug:
			- Upgrades of different type increases the duration of the current upgrade type. (fix would be to separate the different upgrade times)

	Upgrades:
		- Transition from one upgrade to another upgrade seemlessly. (Laser, etc)
		- Remove missile/railgun boolean value before activating the upgrades.

		- Laser Sounds
