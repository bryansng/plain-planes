Loots:
	Hostiles:
		- Use OrderedDict for rocket & adheli method so that can take multiple hits.

	Settings:
		- Screen Resolution based on Users' choice. (Everything might have to be transform scaled)
		- Volume Adjustment by User.

	Bugs:
		- You can't open the ESC button when you didn't click "Resume Game", but you resumed using key "P".
		- You can keep pressing the key "P" and the ship gets moved to the original position.
		- Some parachutes don't drop any drop at all. (Probability problem)
		- Explosion image remains after being defeated, but is removed/updated after Game 2's First Ship Hit.
	
	Menus:
	- Defeated menu. (Restart Game, Quit to Main Menu, Scores, etc)

	Timer:
		- Current Timer runs even when the game is paused. Need better time alternatives. Try looking into time.perf_counter(). (Time = Game Start Time - Process_time)
	
	Upgrades:
		- Forcefield (Nothing can hurt ship at this time, Add a forcefield image)
	
	Refactor:
		- time_game and time_game_play (Make them freely accessible anywhere via the bridge, ai_settings. With this, we don't need to make them as arguments all the time.)









Current:
	Upgrades:
		- Transition from one upgrade to another upgrade seamlessly. (Laser, etc)
		- Upgrade_Timer, when Secondary and Railguns are together, show both upgrades and their timers.
			Bug:
				- [Current] Upgrades does not appear after first round of occurrence.
				- [Current] Upgrades does not appear sometimes.
				- [Current] Upgrades do not disappear after time is up.
	Sounds:
		- Laser Sounds
		- Railgun Sound takes awhile to end.
		- Sync firing sound and change sound mode.








Did:
	- Change coords of where secondary bullet might come out.
	- Sound now don't sound too loud at initial fire.
	- Fix mouse hang at start sometimes.
	- Make parachute shootable.
	- Decrease speed of parachute
	Loots:
		- Firing Modes:
			All based on Time/Cooldown
			- Missiles (Projectiles)
			- Railguns (Projectiles)
			- Lasers (Rect)
		- Parachute Drops:
			- Parachute collide with some objects that drop from the crates. 
			- Probability System
			- Simulates a on stand-still move, so that the player can move the ship to collect the drop.
			- Drop shows the different types of upgrades the user can choose if they want to take the upgrade or not.
	Timer:
		- Timer for the type of upgrades.
	Settings:
		- Ability to change ship's default firing/weapon mode.
	Bug:
		- During Missile firing mode, no parachute or drops are created.
	Upgrades:
		- Transition from one upgrade to another upgrade seamlessly. (ShipBullet, ShipMissile)
		- Remove missile/railgun boolean value before activating the upgrades. (Transition Issues)
		- Upgrade_Timer, when Secondary and Railguns are together, show both upgrades and their timers.
			Bug:
				- Upgrades of different type increases the duration of the current upgrade type. (fix would be to separate the different upgrade times)
				- Second upgrade type doesn't show, while the first upgrade type still remains.
				- First upgrade timer disppears, but Second upgrade timer appears, First upgrade timer's time is added to the Second upgrade timer's.
		- Try if by removing the upgrades_secondary_gun condition in u_rails_shipbullet_collision, will the transition still be seamless.
	Sounds:
		- Missiles Sounds (Increase sound length (Did This) / Decrease Missile rate of fire)
			- Doesn't sync with projectile coming out.
		- Explosions (Extend ship respawn time / Decrease sound length + Adjust Volume (Did This)).
		- Bullet Sounds (Railgun minigun + No Railgun sound)
	Refactor:
		- Upgrades (OOP used badly, the difference between all the upgrades is just the images. Try to put them together and just change the images while calling in game_functions).
