# Plain Planes

You control an aircraft to shoot down other aircrafts. Game includes a myriad of hostile aircrafts. An upgrade drop will appear after shooting down an advanced helicopter. By moving your aircraft over the airdrop, you stand a chance of getting the increased rate of fire, secondary minigun activation, missile or laser upgrade.
