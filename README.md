Hostile Takeover (subject to change)

Aircraft shooting other aircrafts.

<a href="getting_started"></a>Getting Started
---

A simple game made after reading [Python Crash Course](http://www.nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse/) by [*Eric Matthes*](https://ehmatthes.github.io/). The game started its development shortly after I finished reading Project 1: Alien Invasion. There are plans to used what I learnt in Project 2: Data Visualization to create a thorough statistical visualization of the data gathered from playing the game and if possible, make it a multiplayer game that can be played online through a browser using what I learnt in Project 3: Web Applications.

Inspired heavily by my childhood game, [Platypus](http://store.steampowered.com/app/307340/Platypus/).

<a href="choosing_a_text_editor"></a>Python IDE or Text Editors
---
There are many Python IDE or text editors to choose from, ultimately, which to use is subjective, so choose the one that suits you.

Personally, I prefer Geany for Python. You can also download their plugins which support a wide range of functions that you may find useful.

- [Downloading and using Geany-plugins](https://plugins.geany.org/downloads.html)

If you are using Geany. Open run_game.py and press F5.

For other IDEs, just execute the run_game.py
